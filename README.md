# Load Testing Demo

This repo contains an educational load simulation script that runs periodically via GitHub Actions.

- Runs every ~30 minutes for up to 30 minutes.
- Targets only my own test site<a href="https://sigmaseries.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"></a>.
- Low concurrency to stay within fair use.
- For learning purposes only — not for production stress testing.
